The complexity of the biclustering problem depends on the exact problem formulation, and particularly on the merit function used to evaluate the quality of a given bicluster. However most interesting variants of this problem are NP-complete. NP-complete have two conditions. In the simple case that there is only element a(i,j) either 0 or 1 in the binary matrix A, a bicluster is equal to a biclique in the corresponding bipartiate graph. The maximum size bicluster is equivalent to maximum edge biclique in bipartiate graph. In the complex case, the element in matrix A is used to compute the quality of a given bicluster and solve the mre restricted version of the problem. It requires either large computational effort or the use of lossy heuristics to short-circuit the calculation.
